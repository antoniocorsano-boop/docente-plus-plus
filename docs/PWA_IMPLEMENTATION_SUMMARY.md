# PWA Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the Progressive Web App (PWA) features in Docente++.

## Key Features

*   **Service Worker:** The service worker (`sw.js`) is responsible for caching application assets and enabling offline functionality.
*   **Web App Manifest:** The `manifest.json` file provides metadata about the application, such as its name, icons, and display mode.
*   **Offline Access:** Users can access the application even when they are offline, thanks to the caching of resources by the service worker.
*   **Installability:** The application can be installed on the user's home screen or desktop, providing a native-like experience.
