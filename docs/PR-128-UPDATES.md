# PR-128 Updates: Merge Conflict Resolution and Feature Implementation

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Branch**: `copilot/resolve-merge-conflicts-breadcrumbs-assistant`  
**Status**: In Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the resolution of merge conflicts and implementation of missing features for the breadcrumbs and floating assistant functionality.

## Merge Resolution Notes

### Strategy

## Integration Points

### In-Classe Page Integration
The existing `/js/in-classe.js` already includes:
- ✅ SessionManager via `InClasseDataManager` class
- ✅ Deep-link prefill from URL parameters (`getLessonKeyFromURL()`)
- ✅ Audio recording mock in `loadRecordings()` and `addRecording()`
- ✅ localStorage history for activities, homework, evaluations, recordings

The existing `/in-classe.html` includes:
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation structure in place
- ✅ Proper ARIA labels and navigation landmarks

### Floating Assistant Integration
The existing `/js/floating-assistant.js` provides:
- ✅ Base functionality for panel management
- ✅ Message handling and display
- ✅ Voice input interface

The new `/src/ui/floating-assistant/floating-assistant.js` enhances with:
- ✅ Improved accessibility (focus trap, aria-live)
- ✅ Better keyboard navigation
- ✅ MOCK_AI feature flag
- ✅ Screen reader announcements

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Orario Grid**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console on page with orario
   import { initializeScheduleGrid, loadScheduleData } from './src/pages/orario/orario.js';
   
   const container = document.getElementById('schedule-container');
   const data = await loadScheduleData();
   initializeScheduleGrid(data.schedule, container);
   ```

2. **Test Breadcrumbs**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   import { breadcrumbsInstance } from './src/components/breadcrumbs/breadcrumbs.js';
   
   breadcrumbsInstance.updateForPage('in-classe', { title: 'Classe 3A' });
   ```

3. **Test Floating Assistant**
   ```javascript
   // Click floating assistant button or programmatically:
   import { floatingAssistantUI } from './src/ui/floating-assistant/floating-assistant.js';
   
   floatingAssistantUI.open();
   ```

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run existing test suite
npm test

# Expected: All tests pass with no new failures
```

## Notes

- **MOCK_AI Flag**: All AI-related features use mock implementations. Set `MOCK_AI = false` when real API is available.
- **localStorage**: Used extensively for persistence. Consider adding migration strategy for schema changes.
- **CSS Variables**: Code uses CSS custom properties. Ensure they're defined in main stylesheet.
- **Material Icons**: Components depend on Material Symbols font being loaded.
