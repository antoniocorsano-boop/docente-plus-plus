# GitHub Actions Workflow Fix Summary

## Issue Overview
The GitHub Actions workflows in this repository were experiencing recurring failures:
- **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow (deploy-pages.yml) - CRITICAL
- **Create Resources** workflow (create-resources.yml) - FALSE POSITIVE

## Root Cause Analysis

### Deploy to GitHub Pages Failure
The workflow was using outdated GitHub Actions that depended on deprecated dependencies:
- `actions/deploy-pages@v1` internally uses the deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3`
- GitHub automatically fails workflow runs that use deprecated action versions
- This was causing systematic failures across multiple commits

### Create Resources "Failures"
The create-resources workflow was actually working correctly:
- The workflow completes successfully when there's no `create-resources` script defined in package.json
- This is the intended behavior (idempotent design)
- The "failures" were actually graceful completions with no work to do

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated deploy-pages.yml Workflow
Made the following changes to `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`:

```yaml
# BEFORE
- uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
- uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
- uses: actions/deploy-pages@v1

# AFTER
- uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
- uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
- uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

Additional improvements:
- Added `concurrency` control to prevent overlapping deployments
- Added `environment` configuration for proper GitHub Pages deployment tracking
- Added output ID (`id: deployment`) for URL tracking

### 2. No Changes Needed for create-resources.yml
The workflow is functioning as designed and requires no modifications.

### 3. Cleanup
Removed obsolete workflow file at `github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml` (wrong directory, not used by GitHub Actions).

## Testing & Validation

### Security Check
- **CodeQL analysis**: ✅ 0 vulnerabilities found
- **Action versions**: ✅ All using latest stable releases
- **Deprecated dependencies**: ✅ None in use

### Expected Behavior After Fix
When this PR is merged to main:
1. The "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow will run successfully
2. GitHub Pages will deploy correctly
3. The deployment URL will be accessible via the environment output

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` - Updated action versions and added configuration
- `github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml` - Removed (old duplicate)

## Action Items for Repository Owner
1. ✅ Review and merge this PR
2. ⏳ Verify the workflow runs successfully on main after merge
3. ⏳ Confirm GitHub Pages deployment is working
4. ⏳ (Optional) Configure repository settings to ensure GitHub Pages is enabled with "GitHub Actions" as the source
