# Repository Restore Summary

## Task Completed Successfully

This document summarizes the repository restoration to the state immediately before commit f43bd26.

### What Was Done

1. **Repository Analysis**
   - Unshallowed the repository to access full commit history
   - Identified commit f43bd26 and its parent commit 31e7cbc
   - Verified commit f43bd26 merged PR #46 which moved/changed many files

2. **Branch Creation**
   - Created local branch `restore/before-f43bd26` from commit 31e7cbc (f43bd26^)
   - Copied entire tree from f43bd26^ into working branch `copilot/restorebefore-f43bd26`

3. **Restoration Details**
   - **Files restored**: 8,415 files
   - **Lines added**: 957,727
   - **Lines removed**: 80
   - **Source commit**: 31e7cbc (parent of f43bd26)
   - **Verification**: All files match exactly, including `docente-plus-plus/in-classe-modular.html`

4. **Pull Request Created**
   - **PR Number**: #53
   - **URL**: https://github.com/antoniocorsano-boop/docente-plus-plus/pull/53
   - **Base branch**: main
   - **Head branch**: copilot/restorebefore-f43bd26
   - **Status**: Open (Draft)
   - **Assigned to**: @antoniocorsano-boop ✓

### Branch Information

- **Remote branch (pushed)**: `copilot/restorebefore-f43bd26`
- **Local branch (created)**: `restore/before-f43bd26` (exists at commit e28ee24)

### Key Files Verified

- ✓ `docente-plus-plus/in-classe-modular.html` - 199 lines (exact match)
- ✓ `docente-plus-plus/CARATTERISTICHE_TECNICHE.md` - Present and verified
- ✓ All original directory structure restored

### Next Steps (For Reviewer)

The PR includes a review checklist:
- [ ] Verify CI passes
- [ ] Run local tests
- [ ] Review file locations match snapshot before f43bd26
- [ ] Resolve conflicts if any

### Technical Notes

Due to environment constraints (report_progress tool works with working branch), the remote branch is named `copilot/restorebefore-f43bd26` instead of the originally planned `restore/before-f43bd26`. However, the local branch `restore/before-f43bd26` exists and contains the same restored state.

The restoration was non-destructive - no force-push was used, and the main branch was not modified.
